# Simple_SpringBoot_MyBatis_H2_App
A simple Spring boot app using Themeleaf as template engine, MyBatis and H2

You can run it with the java command java -jar committee-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar. And a zip file of the source code that I tried to make it self explanatory (very interested in coding best practices).

# Run:
After launching the app, you can:
    Get access to the web page via:
    http://localhost:8080
    Get access to the json presentation of the output (like in json sample file you sent me):
    http://localhost:8080/api
    I also activated the H2 console (if any need) that could be accessed on:
    http://localhost:8080/h2
